# Eventhype

Eventhype is a clone of the website Eventbrite. It is a website where you can browse events and buy tickets/register to events in your area. If you create an account you can create/update/delete events which people can buy tickets for. You can also bookmark events to be saved.

## How it works 
To create this clone I used Rails as the backend and React-Redux for the frontend.
