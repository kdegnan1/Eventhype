* Architecture and Technologies  
  * Technologies used: Rails, ReactJS, Redux, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Webpack, AWS, Heroku
  * To create this clone I used Rails as the backend and React-Redux for the frontend. 
  * Customized JSON responses with JBuilder to improve efficiency between Rails API and front-end interface.
  * Implemented a two-step user authentication that ensures user privacy and autonomy through frontend and
backend authentication measures using cookies to persist authorization across sessions.
  * Connected Active Record models to Active Storage and AWS3 to store image uploads in the cloud for users to
use custom photos when creating events.
  * Harnessed the unidirectional state management of Redux to simplify React components and directly manage
data.
